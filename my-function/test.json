The two master suites meant we both had our own space and there was lots for the kids to do. Private beach made for an easy summer day and the proximity to Grand Bend was perfect. Communication was great, kitchen was well stocked, beds were comfy and the deck was a little piece of heaven. I highly recommend."},{"date":"September 2022","review":"Neil's cottage was home for our family with 2 small kids for a couple of weeks and it was superb. The place itself is magical with the cottage being nestled in a tree canopy of old pines and oaks,  very serene and quiet with a ton of space and privacy. It really has the best of both worlds given that Grand Bend is a short 5min drive and Bayfield/Goderich/Kincardine also fairly close if you feel like exploring these quaint small beach towns. Neil was very responsive and checked in with us regularly, quite easy to communicate with. I would highly recommend this place!"},{"date":"August 2022","review":"Neil was very attentive , and quick to respond. Whenever there was an issue, he was sure to be on the other end addressing the matter as soon as possible. \nThe property was the perfect layout for our family getaway. And the private beach was absolutely gorgeous. \n** I think some instructions around the stove, and air conditioning would be useful for future guests stays , but over all , a great Host & space !"},{"date":"August 2022","review":"We had a fantastic stay at Neil's beautiful home. Such a great location- close to both the playground and beach. There was tons of space for our multi-family getaway (two tv areas and a shower on every level- awesome!).\nThe beds were very comfortable and we really enjoyed sitting on the covered deck. Quick and easy communication with the host. Thanks for providing us with a lovely place to make such precious memories."},{"date":"August 2022","review":"Neil's place is fantastic all around and we really enjoyed our stay. The house is spacious, clean and has a beautiful kitchen and deck space. We prepared most of our meals so the fact that the kitchen was fully stocked and has modern appliances was a big plus. There were a ton of toys and games that made it a great place for our young kids. Last but not least was the close proximity to a semi-private beach that is pretty much as good as you can get in Ontario! Communication with Neil was easy and responsive. We can't wait to come back and visit!"},{"date":"July 2022","review":"Beautiful cottage!  Spacious and clean.  We enjoyed our stay."},{"date":"July 2022","review":"Recommend the house!"},{"date":"June 2022","review":"This is a great private location for a friend or family trip, but still close enough to the strip as it was less than a 5 minute drive. Neil is a great host and helped us out a lot. He answered right away with any questions that we had. All together a great place to stay and a very nice house as well."},{"date":"June 2022","review":"Neil made us feel welcomed and very comfortable.  He checked in with us to make our stay was going good and if we needed anything.  It really felt like a home away from home.  I would highly recommend staying at this property.  You will not be disappointed !!"}]}
